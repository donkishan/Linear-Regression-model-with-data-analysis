# Linear-Regression-model-with-data-analysis
This project, developed entirely by Kishan H S, applies Linear Regression to predict house prices in Bengaluru based on various features such as location, size, and number of bedrooms. The aim is to create a machine learning model that can accurately estimate house prices in one of India's most dynamic real estate markets. The dataset was preprocessed and explored thoroughly, and the Linear Regression model was trained and evaluated to understand how well it captures the relationships between the input features and the target variable (house price).
